![](utility/img/intro_img.png)


## Content

The repository is composed from different sections 
 
* [Cardiac Image anaysis](https://github.com/baiwenjia/ukbb_cardiac). 
Automated pipeline for image segmentation and motion analysis.

* [Peak detection](https://github.com/baiwenjia/ukbb_cardiac). 

* [Phenotype anaysis](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/diastolic_genetics/tree/master/phenotype_analysis). 
Cardiac phenotype pipeline to investigate the relationships between the myocardial diastolic function parameters and the non-imaging clinical data.

* [Genetic anaysis](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/diastolic_genetics/tree/master/genetic_analysis). 
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis for the derived diastolic function traits.

* [Plots](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/diastolic_genetics/tree/master/plots)
Scatter and box plots of diastolic function.
